    <string name="About_person1">Hello I am Koko the gorilla, I am a female gorilla who participated in linguistic experiments in apes. I understand more than 1,000 words in American sign language, and understand about 2,000 words in spoken English. I was born in the San Francisco Zoo and lived most of my life in Woodside, California. The name Koko is short for the Japanese "nibiko" that means "Fireworker" given to me because of my birth date, July 4th.
When I was informed of the death of actor Robin Williams, whom I met in 2001 and immediately attached to, I was very saddened and even marked the word crying in sign language, which shows the high emotional intelligence I have.
I died on June 19, 2018, at the age of 46.</string>
